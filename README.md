# A Time Traveling Tale of Immutability and the Many Powers of Redux

Often overlooked, Redux is more than just a state management container, it also lays the groundwork for an enhanced developer and debugging experience.

Read only state is a main principle of Redux and this discussion will explore the power of immutability and understand why it is so crucial to a library such as Redux. We will take this knowledge and also examine immutable patterns in conjunction with Redux.

Finally, we will transition from our understanding of immutable state and use it to harness the power of Redux and Redux DevTools by bringing the enhanced developer experience to life.

You will see how easy it is to add time travel debugging into our Redux application and, of course, we will go back in time and do it all over again.
